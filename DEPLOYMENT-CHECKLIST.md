- [ ] Confirm costs are within expected range

## Post-Deployment (Next 24 Hours)

### Monitor

- [ ] Verify consistent success rate

### Optimize (Optional)
- [ ] Review API call counts in logs
- [ ] Consider adding caching if needed
- [ ] Adjust rate limits if necessary

## Success Criteria

âœ… Workflow completes without errors
âœ… Report shows real data (no X marks)
âœ… Competitors identified correctly
âœ… Keywords have search volume data
âœ… SERP rankings visible
âœ… AI insights generated (if configured)
âœ… No authentication errors in logs
âœ… DataForSEO API calls succeed

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Rollback Steps:
1. Edit `supabase/functions/lib/workflow-orchestrator.ts`
2. Change line 15 from:
   ```typescript
   } from './integrations/dataforseo-mcp.ts';
   ```
   to:
   ```typescript
   } from './integrations/dataforseo.ts';
   ```
3. Redeploy the function
4. Investigate the issue

### Common Issues:

**"Invalid request format" error:**
- Check Cloudflare Worker logs
- Verify request payload structure
- See `DEPLOY-MCP-INTEGRATION.md` for details

**"Unauthorized" error:**
- Check DataForSEO credentials in Cloudflare Worker
- Verify secrets are properly set
- Test credentials directly with DataForSEO API

**No data in report:**
- Check Supabase Edge Function logs for errors
- Verify Cloudflare Worker is accessible
- Run `node test-mcp-server.js` to verify

**Timeout errors:**
- API calls may be taking too long
- Consider reducing limits in integration file
- Check DataForSEO API status

## Completion

Once all checkboxes are complete and success criteria met:
- [ ] Migration successful âœ…
