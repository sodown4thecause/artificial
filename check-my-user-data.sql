-- SOLUTIONS BASED ON YOUR USER
-- ============================================

-- If YOU are user_33MUiyUPoo7oi7O4aoR0WOWs103:
--   ‚Üí You've hit the rate limit (10/10 reports today)
--   ‚Üí Solution 1: Reset rate limit for testing:
--      DELETE FROM daily_report_limits WHERE user_id = 'user_33MUiyUPoo7oi7O4aoR0WOWs103' AND report_date = CURRENT_DATE;
--   ‚Üí Solution 2: Wait until tomorrow (resets automatically)
--   ‚Üí Solution 3: Check your existing reports:
--      SELECT * FROM reports r JOIN workflow_runs w ON r.workflow_id = w.id WHERE w.user_id = 'user_33MUiyUPoo7oi7O4aoR0WOWs103' ORDER BY r.captured_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- If YOU are user_33OYNx0A1WU3wRrxNmxpTvA8Bec:
--   ‚Üí You have capacity (1/10 reports today, 7 total)
--   ‚Üí Check if your latest report exists:
--      SELECT * FROM reports r JOIN workflow_runs w ON r.workflow_id = w.id WHERE w.user_id = 'user_33OYNx0A1WU3wRrxNmxpTvA8Bec' ORDER BY r.captured_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- If YOU are a DIFFERENT user (3rd user):
--   ‚Üí You haven't completed onboarding yet
--   ‚Üí Solution: Complete onboarding at /onboarding
--   ‚Üí Or use the test data script from ACTION-PLAN-NO-WORKFLOWS.md

-- QUICK FIX: View report for User 2
-- ============================================
-- If you want to see User 2's report as a test:
SELECT

    r.payload
FROM reports r
JOIN workflow_runs w ON r.workflow_id = w.id
WHERE w.user_id = 'user_33OYNx0A1WU3wRrxNmxpTvA8Bec'
