# FREE Web Scraping Alternatives ðŸ†“

This BI Dashboard now uses **100% FREE** web scraping solutions instead of paid services like Firecrawl.

## Primary Solution: Jina AI Reader

**[Jina AI Reader](https://jina.ai/reader/)** is a completely free service that:
- âœ… Converts any URL to clean markdown
- âœ… Removes ads, popups, and navigation clutter  
- âœ… Extracts main content with perfect formatting
- âœ… No API key required
- âœ… No rate limits for reasonable usage
- âœ… Excellent for competitor content analysis

### Usage
Simply append any URL to `https://r.jina.ai/` and get clean markdown content.

Example:
```
https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com
```

## Fallback: Native Scraping

Our system also includes a **native scraping fallback** using:
- Basic HTML parsing with regex
- Content extraction and cleaning
- Technology detection
- Heading and CTA extraction

## Cost Comparison

| Service | Cost | Quality | Rate Limits |

## Implementation

The scraping system now:

1. **Tries Jina AI Reader first** (free, excellent quality)
2. **Falls back to native scraping** (free, good quality)
3. **Processes up to 8 competitor URLs per workflow**
4. **Includes respectful delays** to avoid overwhelming free services
5. **Provides detailed logging** of success/failure rates

## Results

Each scraped competitor website provides:
- âœ… Page title and meta description
- âœ… All headings (H1-H6) for content structure
- âœ… Clean main content (up to 2000 chars)
- âœ… Call-to-action detection
- âœ… Technology stack detection
- âœ… Image references

## Environmental Impact

By using free services, you can:
- **Save $50-100+/month** on scraping costs
- **Get high-quality results** from Jina AI Reader
- **Maintain reliable fallbacks** with native scraping
- **Scale without usage-based pricing**

## Configuration

No additional API keys required! The system works out of the box.

Optional environment variables:
```bash
SCRAPY_SERVICE_URL=http://your-custom-scrapy-service:8000/scrape  # If you deploy your own
```

Firecrawl is now **optional** (was previously required):
```bash
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Optional fallback
```
